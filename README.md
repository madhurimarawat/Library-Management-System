<h1>Description</h1>
--> One of the primary goals of frontend development is to create a smooth or "frictionless"Â user experience.<br>
--> First a user friendly and responsive interface through frontend was developed.<br>
--> All visual features, pixels and cross browser compatibility will be taken in account.<br>
--> The website design is simple and easy to work with along with an attractive interface.<br>
--> Websites works well on multiple devices and screen sizes, which is possible as it involvesÂ responsive design.
